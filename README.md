# Approximate-Algorithms-for-Scheduling-Unrelated-Parallel-Machines

## Description
This project implements approximate algorithms for scheduling unrelated parallel machines,
inspired by influential research articles.
It aims to provide efficient solutions for the allocation of tasks to machines,
minimizing the overall execution time (makespan).
